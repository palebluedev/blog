I've been a software engineer for over 5 years now, it started out as a hobby and grew into something more
than I could have ever dreamed.

### So with that said what do I want to do with this blog?
Theres nothing revolutionary I'm trying to do here, I want to help other people who might be looking for answers and myself with something to look 
back at.


### Why not use my real name?
The’re two main reasons for this, one I don’t care to build a personal brand, two I understand the dangers of the internet I will accept criticism for sure but I’m not going to open myself up to personal attacks. This obviously has its downsides in the sense that my credibility is an unknown quantity but I’m fine with that.
